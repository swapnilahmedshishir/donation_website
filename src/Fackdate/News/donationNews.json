The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention' (CDC) mortality rates in the U.S. for 2019 show the average life expectancy for men was 76.3 years, while the average for women was 81.4 years. Most gaps in life expectancy can be explained by the risk factors that people engage in. The disparity between men and women, for example, is because women tend to engage in less risky behavior than men, and suffer fewer vehicular accidents.",
